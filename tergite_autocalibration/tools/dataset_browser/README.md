**Note: This is forked from [quantifiles](https://gitlab.com/dcrielaard/quantifiles/).
We are maintaining this modified version of quantifiles as a supplementary tool to browse calibration plots.**

Welcome to Quantifiles, a PyQt5 application designed for viewing dataset files generated by [Quantify-core](https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-core/). With Quantifiles, you can easily browse and visualize the contents of your data directory, including the ability to view a plot of the data and browse snapshots.

## Installation

### Install from source

To install only Quantifiles from source, first clone the main autocalibration repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tergite/tergite-autocalibration.git
cd tergite-autocalibration/tergite_autocalibration/tools/dataset_browser
```

Then, install the application in a virtual environment using pip:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

You can launch the application by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
quantifiles [--datadir DATADIR] [--liveplotting] [--loglevel LOGLEVEL]
```

If you don't specify the data directory, you can still access it by selecting File->Open in the application.

Alternatively, you can also use the executable file located in the Scripts folder, which will be generated upon installation.

To start the application from within Python, run:

```python
from quantifiles import quantifiles

quantifiles()  # This will start the application, optionally you can pass the data directory as an argument.
```

**Tip:** The plots can be copied to the clipboard by right-clicking on them.

## Install updates from the original quantifiles repository

Since this subdirectory is forked from the quantifiles repository, it might happen that there are updates in the quantifiles repository.
To merge the updates into this fork, we are using `git subtree`.
This sections explains how to update the fork, step by step.

First, make sure that you have cloned the tergite-autocalibration repository.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:tergite/tergite-autocalibration.git
cd tergite-autocalibration
```

Then, add the remote to the original quantifiles repository.
```shell
git remote add quantifiles git@gitlab.com:dcrielaard/quantifiles.git
```

If you type, `git remote -v`, you should be able to see the remote `quantifiles` now.
Fetch the most recent changes by typing:
```shell
git fetch quantifiles
```

Now, assuming that there you can pull the changes into using a git subtree.
```
git pull --prefix=tergite_autocalibration/tools/dataset_browser quantifiles main
```

Resolve any conflicts that might have occurred during the merge and push the changes to the origin repository.
