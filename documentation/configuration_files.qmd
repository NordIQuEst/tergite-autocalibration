# Configuration Files

## Hardware Configuration file (json):
Here the connection is made between the Qblox cluster physical ports and clocks to the qubits and couplers of the QPU.

The file must be placed at the directory `tergite-acl/config_dir/`

Given a `.csv` file after a mixer calibration the function `...` can create instantly the corresponding `JSON` file.

## Device Configuration file (toml):

Here we set reasonable initial parameters

## VNA resonator & qubit frequencies

Here we input the initial values for the resonator and qubits frequencies, assumed that they have been acquired through VNA measurements, design targets or previous manual measurements.
`/tergite_acl/config/VNA_values.py`

## Coupler to SPI mapping
