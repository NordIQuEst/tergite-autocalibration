Welcome to Quantifiles, a PyQt5 application designed for viewing dataset files generated by [Quantify-core](https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-core/). With Quantifiles, you can easily browse and visualize the contents of your data directory, including the ability to view a plot of the data and browse snapshots.

This project contains a calibration supervisor, a collection of calibration schedules and a collection of post-processing & analysis routines.  
It was developed and tested on WACQT Quantum Computer at Chalmers University of Technology.

**This project is developed by a core group of collaborators.**    
**Chalmers Next Labs AB (CNL) takes on the role of managing and maintaining this project.**

## Version Control

The Tergite stack is developed on a separate version control system and mirrored on GitHub.
If you are reading this on GitHub, then you are looking at a mirror. 


## Dependencies

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)

## Quick Start

- Ensure you have [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html) installed. 
 (_You could simply have python +3.9 installed instead._)
- Ensure you have [redis server](https://redis.io/) running

```shell
redis-server
```

- Clone the repo

<<<<<<< HEAD
```shell
git clone git@github.com:tergite/tergite-autocalibration.git
```

- Create conda environment

```shell
conda create -n tac -y python=3.10
conda activate tac
```

- Install the application

```shell
cd tergite-autocalibration
pip install -e .
```

- Copy the `dot-env-template.txt` file to `.env` and 
  update the environment variables there appropriately.

```shell
cp dot-env-template.txt .env
```

- Start the automatic calibration
=======
To install Quantifiles from source, first clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/dcrielaard/quantifiles.git
cd quantifiles
```

Then, install the application in a virtual environment using pip:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Install with pipenv

If you prefer to use pipenv for managing your virtual environment, you can install Quantifiles with the following command:

```bash
pipenv install git+https://gitlab.com/dcrielaard/quantifiles.git#egg=quantifiles
```

## Usage

You can launch the application by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
quantifiles [--datadir DATADIR]
```

If you don't specify the data directory, you can still access it by selecting File->Open in the application.

Alternatively, you can also use the executable file located in the Scripts folder, which will be generated upon installation.

## Official documentation

The documentation is mantained in using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). The documentation for the public version of the code is available [here](https://tergite.github.io/tergite-autocalibration/getting_started.html). 
To visualise the lates version of the documentation, install Quarto locally and build the website to browse the documentation. Make sure to have quarto in your PATH before you crate the conda environment to simplify its use in VSCode. You can install the Quarto extension
