# How to use the /development directory

During the development, we are using a lot of fast-coded analysis scripts that are useful for our co-workers, but not necessarily reached the stage of mature software.
This directory should be structured as follows:
- `notebooks`: Contains all notebooks with ideas and analysis notebooks
- `scripts`: Contains helpful scripts to do small tasks

As soon as we figure that parts of the code reach a stage of maturity and usefulness, we can add them to the codebase.

Please make sure to:
- Put your name somewhere, so, people know who to contact for questions
- Give some basic instructions on how to run it
- Provide two to three bullet points what the code is doing (does not have to be a separate .md document, can be also just a comment in the code)
