# Configs

This is the default directory to store configuration files.

Please put in here:
- `device_config.toml`: Information about the starting values of the quantities of interest.
- `hardware_config.json`: Information about which modules of the cluster are going to be in use.

Both configuration files should match the cluster and the qubits that you are planning to use for your measurements.
You can find the configuration files for each cooldown under `/data/devices`
